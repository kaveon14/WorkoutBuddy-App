//TODO how to keep the databases in sync
/* Have the remote DB store everything.
Have a local DB on the device that reflects the remote DB.
Have the remote DB contain a version number. At some point, either scheduled or triggered,
the app compares the version numbers in the local and remote and if the local is
out of date it will update to the current remote DB. */
